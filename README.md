# jupyter-notebooks

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks I have written to help myself practice. A lot of the are AI/ML focused but some focus on other things (web crawling, data analysis).

I first sort by where the notebook is intended to run (for example `aws` or `local`) and then by domain (for example `aiml` for Machine Learning or `browser` for browser automation).

Hope some of these are helpful to others!
