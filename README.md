# jupyter-notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for a variety of tasks (mostly AIML related).

I try my best to sort things into appropriate categories. Notebooks are sorted based on where they are meant to be run (for example `aws` or `local`) and what the core focus is (browser automations in `browser`, AI and ML notebooks in `aiml`).
