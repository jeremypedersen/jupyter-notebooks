# LangChain Quickstart

The code here comes directly from [the LangChain quickstart tutorial page](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart/#building-with-langchain).

That page is a crash course in basic LangChain usage. There are a few files here:

- `langchain-quickstart-basic.py`: Covers all the LangChain basics: invoking a model, creating a chain, setting up a chat, creating a vector store and generating embeddings, and creating an agent
- `call-server.ipynb`: Calls RESTful API created by `langserve` in `serve.py`
- `serve.py`: Encapsulates a LangChain Agent as a RESTful API using `langserve`
